%Plots should be fine with K=5. 
%Not sure about the math. It might be enough to just refer to task 5 and maybe say something about the output limit.

Task 7: Done

Task 8: Done
%The plotted controller is far to slow. Plots should be redone with a better K-value.
%Not sure if the plots should be redone or if 500 is close enough to 572. I think referring to dead beat controllers in the explanation would be a good idea. And w = 0 so we assume that the robot is aligned.
%Comment: the slowness come from that the robot moves very little close to the target position. Don't know if there are better solution according to the task.

Task 9: Working
%Plots for the correct K values? 
Needs comparison with how the controllers evolve when used separately
