The discrete state would be expected to first go into $q_1$ for a short while when the robot turns towards the direction of the goal. Then it should go into state $q_2$ for a while when driving towards the goal, and finally it should end up in state 3 when it has reached the goal. This is the exact behavior that is shown in figure \ref{fig:states}.
