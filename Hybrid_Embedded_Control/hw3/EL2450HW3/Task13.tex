$p$ is the importance of how much the angle matters compared to how much the robots distance from the line matters. A large value of $p$ will give more weight to the angle but be more lenient of transnational errors, while a small $p$ will make the robot turn more to stay on the line, but less to keep the direction of the line. $p$ is a additional proportional controller that applies on the angular velocity so it scales $K_\omega$. This can lead to instability or larger oscillation in the $\theta$ coordinate. In the stable situation with a large $p$, the robot will still be able to follow a line. But it will oscillate around the line as it following the line. So it will be harder to following the line perfectly.
