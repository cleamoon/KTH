If both the distance and relative orientation of the robot are controlled at the same time, the robot might start driving in a direction that takes it into another region than the goal region. Making sure that the robot is aligned towards the correct region before any translational motion ensures that the robot will stay in a valid state. Beside this situation, the movement might take long time if the desired orientation differs greatly from the desired movement direction. This is because that the robot tries to maintain in the direction that is not the movement direction so it will constantly stop and rotate toward the desired direction and rotate back to continue moving without any benefit. So it is better to move to the desired location before rotate to the desired direction.
