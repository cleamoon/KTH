As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:perf-full}, the robot performed reasonably well. There are some concerns that the behavior is a bit uncontrolled, which might have caused it to occasionally cross into a forbidden state. A plot displaying the robots full radius from the path combined by a grid showing the states would have been interesting.
