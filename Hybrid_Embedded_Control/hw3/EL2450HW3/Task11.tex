The controller drives the robot to a position orthogonal to the goal position on the line between $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_g, y_g)$. Since $K_\omega$ is set to give a dead beat controller the robot should get close to to the goal position if it starts in the direction of the goal. Otherwise it will not reach the goal position.
