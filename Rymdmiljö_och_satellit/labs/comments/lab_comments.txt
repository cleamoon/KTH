Thermal simulation commments
	On nodal diagram, radiator couplings with the environment. (Sun and the Earth)
	Temperature of the equipments are important. (We need the plots from the equipments.)
	Cold case equipments should be above 0 degree.  (What if we don't get that?)
	Re-optimize. (Smaller radiator possibly.)


	0.6?? -> 0.577 
	0.092 -> 0.092
	?.??? -> 0.2
	0.488 -> 0.462

	Pd = Pc = C*(Teq - Trad)
	150 W = 150W = C(Teq-293K)
	Teq < 40  => 150/C = Teq - 293 => 150/C + 293 < 273+40 => C >= 7.5 (for each face)


Radiation simulation comments
	Increase the thickness of the walls.
	Silicon on Solar panels.
	<< How do get from the stopping power to the radiation curve >> should be in the rapport.
	Describe the ray tracing algorithm. 
	Tables containing the numbers.
	Discussion.
	Coordinate system.
